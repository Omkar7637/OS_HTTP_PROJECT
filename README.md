# OS_HTTP_PROJECT

This project demonstrates the step-by-step development of a basic TCP/HTTP server using **C and socket programming** in a Linux environment (WSL supported).

Each day is organized into a separate folder with:
- **Incremental code examples** (e.g., socket creation, bind, listen, accept)
- **Images/screenshots** showing terminal output or client-server communication
- **Daily tasks** and implementation progress in C

The goal is to build a working HTTP-like server from scratch while understanding the low-level networking concepts behind TCP/IP, socket APIs, and server-client communication.

Ideal for students or anyone learning **network programming in C**.
