## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is:

* A protocol used for communication between **clients (like web browsers)** and **servers (like your backend)**.
* It's the foundation of data exchange on the **World Wide Web**.

### Example:

When you type `http://example.com` in your browser:

1. Your browser (the **client**) sends an **HTTP request** to `example.com`.
2. The server replies with an **HTTP response** (like an HTML page).
3. Your browser shows you the content.
